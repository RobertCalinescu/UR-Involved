## The “Why” (Reason)

To solve the problem of fragmented and inaccessible student club information.

Currently, students struggle to find centralized information about active clubs, while club executives lack a unified platform to manage members and events. **UR Clubs** aims to bridge this gap by providing a single, reliable platform that connects students with campus organizations.

## The “Who” (Target Users)

### North Star Customers
- **University Students:** Looking to discover and join extracurricular activities.
- **University Clubs:** Managing club membership, events, and communication.

### Carryover Customers
- **University Community:** Community members that are involved with student clubs.

## Impact

> “When we are done, the fragmented and manual process of managing student clubs will become a centralized, digital, and automated reality.”

To achieve this, we will:
- Design a user-friendly interface for easy club discovery.
- Implement a robust database for accurate membership and event tracking.
- Deliver a functional **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** supporting basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for club data.
