# UR Clubs (Group C)

**Course:** ENSE 281 – Software Engineering Management
**Semester:** Winter 2026  

---

## 📖 Project Description

UR Clubs is a web-based software application designed to centralize student club management, event tracking, and membership communication at the University of Regina.

Developed as a group project for **ENSE 281**, this application follows a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach and implements the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern. The project simulates a real-world software engineering environment using **Agile/Scrum methodologies**, iterative development, and collaborative project management through **GitHub**.

## 🎯 The “Why” (Reason)

To solve the problem of fragmented and inaccessible student club information.

Currently, students struggle to find centralized information about active clubs, while club executives lack a unified platform to manage members and events. **UR Clubs** aims to bridge this gap by providing a single, reliable platform that connects students with campus organizations.

## 👥 The “Who” (Target Users)

### Primary Audience
- **University Students:** Looking to discover and join extracurricular activities.
- **Club Executives:** Managing club membership, events, and communication.

### User Context
Our users are primarily located on campus and access information digitally through mobile devices and laptops. At present, they rely on scattered social media pages and physical posters, which makes discovery and organization inefficient.

## 🚀 Impact

> “When we are done, the fragmented and manual process of managing student clubs will become a centralized, digital, and automated reality.”

To achieve this, we will:
- Design a user-friendly interface for easy club discovery.
- Implement a robust database for accurate membership and event tracking.
- Deliver a functional **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** supporting basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for club data.
